# Maxima-Jupyter

[![Binder][mybinder-badge]][mybinder]

An enhanced interactive environment for the computer algebra system Maxima,
based on CL-Jupyter, a Jupyter kernel for Common Lisp, by Frederic Peschanski.
Thanks, Frederic!

This file describes the installation and usage of Maxima-Jupyter on a local
machine, but you can try out Maxima-Jupyter without installing anything by
clicking on the Binder badge above.

## Examples

- [MaximaJupyterExample.ipynb][] &mdash; General usage of Maxima from within
  Jupyter Notebook.

- [MaximaJupyterTalk.ipynb][] &mdash; My notes for a talk given to the Portland
  Python User Group.

- [Plots.ipynb][] &mdash; Usage of plotting facilities from within Jupyter
  Notebook.

These examples make use of [nbviewer][].
You can submit a link to your own notebook to tell nbviewer to render it.

Note that the Github notebook renderer (i.e., what you see if you click on a
notebook file in the Github file browser) is currently (November 2018) somewhat
suboptimal ([bug report][]); it renders math as plain text, not as typeset
formulas.

## Installation

Maxima-Jupyter may be installed on a machine using a local installation, a
[repo2docker][] installation, or via a Docker image.

## Local Installation

### Requirements

To try Maxima-Jupyter you need :

 - a Maxima executable

   - built with a Common Lisp implementation which has native threads

     - SBCL works for sure

     - Clozure CL works for sure

     - Other implementations which support the Bordeaux Threads package
       might work. The [Bordeaux Threads project description][] says
       "Supports all major Common Lisp implementations: SBCL, CCL, Lispworks, Allegro, ABCL, ECL, Clisp."
       Aside from SBCL and CCL (i.e. Clozure CL) which are known to work,
       the others in that list are untested with maxima-jupyter.

     - Note also that ECL might theoretically work, since it is supported
       by Bordeaux Threads. However, nobody (neither Maxima-Jupyter 
       developers nor users) has been able to get ECL to work,
       therefore you should assume **ECL does not work** with Maxima-Jupyter.
       SBCL and Clozure CL are known to work, try those instead.

     - Note specifically that GCL is not supported by Bordeaux Threads,
       and therefore **GCL cannot work** with maxima-jupyter.

   - You might or might not need to build Maxima. (A) If you have available
     a Maxima binary package compiled with a compatible Lisp implementation
     (i.e. SBCL, Clozure CL, Lispworks, etc. as enumerated above),
     then you do not need to build Maxima. (B) Otherwise, you must install
     a compatible Lisp implementation and compile Maxima yourself.

 - [Quicklisp][]

   - When you load Maxima-Jupyter into Maxima for the first time,
     Quicklisp will download some dependencies automatically.
     Good luck.

 - Python 3.2 or above

 - Jupyter, or IPython 3.x

 - If the build aborts because the file `zmq.h` is missing, you may need to
   install the development files for the high-level C binding for ZeroMQ.
   On debian-based systems, you can satisfy this requirement by installing
   the package `libczmq-dev`.

### Installing Maxima-Jupyter

The following installation methods are still relatively new. If you experience
any issues than please use the "Old Methods" detailed later in the document.

First you must install Jupyter, then you can install Maxima-Jupyter. If you
plan on using JupyterLab then you must install with the `--user` option.

     python3 -m pip install --user jupyter jupyterlab

Once Jupyter is installed you can either install from the source files of this
repository, or you can install via the AUR if you are using Arch Linux.

#### Method 1. Source Based Installation

To install from the current source files first download the source files and
then start a shell in the source directory. Then start Maxima and load the
initialization script.

```sh
$ maxima
Maxima 5.43.0 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp SBCL 1.5.5
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) load("load-maxima-jupyter.lisp");
```

After the install script has loaded then install using *one* of the kernel 
types.

1. User specific Quicklisp kernel: `jupyter_install();`
2. User specific binary image kernel: `jupyter_install_image();`
3. System-wide Quicklisp bundled kernel: `jupyter_system_install(true, "pkg/");`

After the installation is complete then exit Maxima. For the System-wide
installation copy the files in `pkg` to the system root, i.e. 
`sudo cp -r pkg/* /` on Linux.

#### Method 2. Installation on Arch/Manjaro

The package for Arch Linux is [maxima-jupyter-git][]. Building and installing
(including dependencies) can be accomplished with:

```sh
yaourt -Sy maxima-jupyter-git
```

Alternatively use ``makepkg``:

```sh
curl -L -O https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/maxima-jupyter-git.tar.gz
tar -xvf maxima-jupyter-git.tar.gz
cd maxima-jupyter-git
makepkg -Csri
```

Please consult the [Arch Wiki][] for more information regarding installing
packages from the AUR.

### Installing Maxima-Jupyter (Old Method)

First you must install Jupyter, then you can install Maxima-Jupyter.

I installed Jupyter via:

     python3 -m pip install jupyter

For Maxima-Jupyter, there are two kernel installation methods.
In both methods, the effect of the installation command is to create a file
named `kernel.json` which tells Jupyter where to find Maxima-Jupyter.
Note that Maxima-Jupyter installation DOES NOT copy any Maxima-Jupyter files;
it only creates `kernel.json` which points to the location of Maxima-Jupyter
in your file system.

With the `--user` option in Method 1 or Method 2,
the `kernel.json` file is created in a directory somewhere under your home directory.
Otherwise, `kernel.json` is created in a system directory.
You might need superuser privilege (via `sudo` for example) to execute a system installation,
if the directory into which `kernel.json` is copied is not user-writable.

Note that `jupyter --paths` lists file system paths used by Jupyter;
kernels are sought in the paths under `data`.
Also, `jupyter kernelspec list` tells the kernels which are known to Jupyter.

For the record, on my system, a system installation copies `kernel.json`
into `/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/maxima/kernel.json`
and a user installation copies `kernel.json`
into `/home/robert/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/maxima/kernel.json`.

#### Method 1. Maxima-Jupyter binary executable installation (Old Method)

The first installation method is to create a binary executable image,
as detailed in [make-maxima-jupyter-recipe.txt][].
After creating that image, execute one of these two commands to tell Jupyter about it.

For a system installation,

```sh
python3 ./install-maxima-jupyter.py --exec=path/to/maxima-jupyter-image
```

For a user installation,

```sh
python3 ./install-maxima-jupyter.py --exec=path/to/maxima-jupyter-image --user
```

#### Method 2. Maxima-Jupyter loadable source installation (Old Method)

The second installation method executes Maxima and then loads Maxima-Jupyter into Maxima.
The advantange to this method is that the normal initialization behavior of Maxima,
such as loading `maxima-init.mac`, is preserved.

Note that in order for this method to work, Quicklisp needs be loaded by default
in every Maxima session. See Quicklisp documentation for details.

For a system installation,

```sh
python3 ./install-maxima-jupyter.py --root=`pwd`
```

where the shell command `pwd` emits the current working directory
(which must be the Maxima-Jupyter top-level directory,
since it contains `install-maxima-jupyter.py`).

For a user installation,

```sh
python3 ./install-maxima-jupyter.py --root=`pwd` --user
```

The option `--maxima` may also be used to specify the location of the Maxima executable.
If not specified, the command which launches Maxima is just `maxima`,
therefore the first instance of `maxima` in the PATH environment variable
is the one which is executed.

### Code Highlighting Installation

Highlighting Maxima code is handled by CodeMirror in the notebook
and Pygments in HTML export.

The CodeMirror mode for Maxima is [maxima.js][]. To install it, find the
CodeMirror mode installation directory, create a directory named `maxima` there,
copy [maxima.js][] to the `maxima` directory, and update
`codemirror/mode/meta.js` as shown in [codemirror-mode-meta-patch][]. Yes, this
is pretty painful, sorry about that.

The Pygments lexer for Maxima is maxima_lexer.py. To install it, find the
Pygments installation directory, copy [maxima_lexer.py][] to the `lexers` directory, and
update `lexers/_mapping.py` as shown in [pygments-mapping-patch][]. Yes, this is
pretty painful too.

### Running Maxima-Jupyter

Maxima-Jupyter may be run from a local installation in console mode by the following.

```sh
jupyter console --kernel=maxima
```

Notebook mode is initiated by the following.

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

When you enter stuff to be evaluated, you must include the usual trailing
semicolon or dollar sign:

```
In [1]: 2*21;
Out[1]: 42

In [2]:
```

## repo2docker Usage

Maxima-Jupyter may be run as a Docker image managed by repo2docker which will
fetch the current code from GitHub and handle all the details of running the
Jupyter Notebook server.

First you need to install repo2docker (`sudo` may be required)

```sh
pip install jupyter-repo2docker
```

Once repo2docker is installed then the following will build and start the
server. Directions on accessing the server will be displayed once the image
is built.

```sh
jupyter-repo2docker --user-id=1000 --user-name=mj https://github.com/robert-dodier/maxima-jupyter
```

## Docker Image

A Docker image of Maxima-Jupyter may be built using the following command
(`sudo` may be required). This image is based on the docker image
`archlinux/base`.

```sh
docker build --tag=maxima-jupyter .
```
If you'd like to build with a different user than the default (`mj`), you may
override it with the following:

```sh
docker build --build-arg NB_USER=alice --tag=maxima-jupyter .
```

After the image is built the container may be run with:

```sh
docker run -it maxima-jupyter
```

The `Dockerfile` makes use of the `ENTRYPOINT` command; the default behaviour
executes the `jupyter` binary with the arguments `console --kernel=maxima`. 

If you'd like to run using Juypter's notebook web server, you may do the
following to override the default use of `console`:

```sh
docker run -it \
    -v `pwd`/notebooks:/home/USER/maxima-jupyter/examples \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    maxima-jupyter \
    notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

where the last line is the set of arguments to `jupyter` that cause it to run
in the notebook server mode.

To run the Bash shell on the container, just override the entry point:

```sh
docker run -it --entrypoint=bash maxima-jupyter
``` 

If you cannot build the Docker image, you may use a 
[pre-built one](https://hub.docker.com/r/calyau/maxima-jupyter)
by subsituting the Docker image name `maxima-jupyter` in the above `docker`
commands with `calyau/maxima-jupyter`. Note that the default user on the
`calyau` image is not `mj`, but is rather `oubiwann`.

Additional examples of notebooks created using this mode have been created
here (taken from the Maxima tutorial):
[https://github.com/calyau/maxima-tutorial-notebooks](https://github.com/calyau/maxima-tutorial-notebooks).
